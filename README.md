EasyWiki
========

EasyWiki is a Chrome extension that simplifies your journey down the Wikipedia rabbit-hole! No more 57 tabs! We &hearts; popovers!

## How does it work?

* Install the extension.

* Turn EasyWiki `ON` by clicking the EasyWiki button on the toolbar.

* Now, whenever you hover on a [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org) link on any website, a popover will show up with the description of that article, so that you do not have to open a new tab everytime.

## Will it create a mess of popovers?

Most certainly, it wouldn't. It waits for at least 700 milliseconds before bringing up the popover.
